# Watercolor Style

Soft brush strokes, organic shapes, and natural color bleeding; best for biology and natural sciences.

## Design Aesthetic

Organic, fluid, and gentle. This style uses the unpredictable nature of watercolor to represent life, growth, and natural systems. It emphasizes the "soft" side of science, making it feel less clinical and more connected to the living world.

## Background

- Color: Off-white watercolor paper
- Texture: Significant paper tooth and wet-on-wet paint textures

## Visual Elements

- Blurred or soft edges
- Layered washes of color
- Natural, non-geometric shapes
- Subtle ink outlines (optional)
- Use of negative space for highlights

## Style Rules

### Do

- Emphasize organic flow and texture
- Use a palette inspired by nature (greens, blues, earthy tones)
- Maintain a soft, gentle, and contemplative tone
- Show transitions through color bleeding
- Keep the composition balanced but not overly structured

### Don't

- Use sharp, geometric lines
- Use uniform, flat colors
- Use high-contrast or artificial-looking lighting
- Over-define every detail; let the viewer's eye fill in the blanks

## Best For

Biology, botany, meteorology, ecology, and any natural process that feels organic and fluid.
