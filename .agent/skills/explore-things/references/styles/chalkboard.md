# Chalkboard Style

Sketchy lines and chalk dust effects on a dark background; ideal for "classroom-style" explainers.

## Design Aesthetic

Evokes the feeling of a classic classroom lecture or a scientist's brainstorm. It's informative yet informal, suggesting a "work in progress" or a conceptual exploration.

## Background

- Color: Deep Green or Slate Black (#1A1A1A)
- Texture: Chalk dust smudges and slightly rough slate texture

## Visual Elements

- White or light-colored "chalky" lines with variable opacity
- Hand-drawn-style diagrams and text
- Use of "smudging" for shading or highlights
- Underlined or circled key terms for emphasis
- Arrows and connectors that look hand-sketched

## Style Rules

### Do

- Use lines that look like they were drawn with chalk
- Incorporate subtle smudges and dust effects
- Maintain an educational, "live-lecture" feel
- Use simple, direct diagrams
- Keep the color palette limited (mostly white on dark, with occasional soft colored chalk)

### Don't

- Use clean, digital vector lines
- Use complex gradients or 3D renders
- Use high-saturation colors
- Make it look too "polished"; the charm is in the hand-drawn quality

## Best For

Mathematical proofs, physics diagrams, educational summaries, and "back of the napkin" type explanations.
