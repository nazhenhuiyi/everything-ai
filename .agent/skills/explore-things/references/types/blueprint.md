# Blueprint Style

Technical drawing style with white lines on a blue background, presenting formal engineering precision.

## Design Aesthetic

Reflects traditional architectural and engineering plans. Highly structured, formal, and analytical. Uses technical conventions to convey depth and measurement.

## Background

- Color: Deep Cyan or Navy Blue (#003366)
- Texture: Subtle blueprint paper grid or texture

## Visual Elements

- Fine white or light blue lines
- Orthographic or isometric projections
- Dimension lines and technical measurements
- Grid overlays
- Formal, blocky annotations

## Style Rules

### Do

- Use consistent, thin white lines for all elements
- Maintain a grid-aligned layout
- Use formal engineering symbols where appropriate
- Focus on structure and scale
- Keep the color palette strictly monochromatic (shades of blue and white)

### Don't

- Use organic or hand-drawn shapes
- Add color beyond blue and white
- Use 3D shading or highlights (keep it flat)
- Include decorative elements

## Best For

Inventions, infrastructure, architecture, complex machines, and any system where precise structure is key.
