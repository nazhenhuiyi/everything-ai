# Process (流程/原理图)

Showing the flow of energy, information, matter, or the sequence of a physical phenomenon.

## Core Objective
To visualize dynamic changes, cycles, or invisible forces.

## Visual Strategy
- Use arrows to indicate direction and flow.
- Numbered steps for sequential processes.
- Visual metaphors for invisible elements (e.g., blue arrows for cold air, red for hot).

## Best For
Photosynthesis, the water cycle, networking packets traversing a router, weather patterns, and industrial manufacturing lines.

## Prompt Construction Tip
Identify the "flow" and the key stages (e.g., "A process diagram of the internal combustion engine four-stroke cycle, with arrows indicating air-fuel flow and exhaust").
