# DK Scientific Style

High-definition, clean, 3D-rendered look against a white background, characteristic of DK publishing books.

## Design Aesthetic

Extremely clear, hyper-realistic, and clinical. Subjects are typically isolated on a pure white background to eliminate distractions. The focus is on precision, clarity, and factual representation.

## Background

- Color: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- Texture: Clean, no texture

## Visual Elements

- 3D-rendered look with soft shadows and highlights
- Precise, clean edges
- High-contrast colors to differentiate components
- Clear, san-serif labels for components
- Use of "callouts" for small details

## Style Rules

### Don't
