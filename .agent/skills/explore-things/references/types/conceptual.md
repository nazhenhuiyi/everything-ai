# Conceptual Style

Abstract but logical, using minimalist shapes and connectors to represent non-physical entities or cycles.

## Design Aesthetic

Minimalist, clean, and symbolic. Uses geometry and color to represent information or energy flow. It avoids literal representation in favor of clarifying the underlying logic or relationship between components.

## Background

- Color: Neutral Light Gray or Soft White
- Texture: Smooth, minimal

## Visual Elements

- Simple geometric shapes (circles, squares, arrows)
- Clean, thin connection lines
- Symbolic color coding
- Minimalist icons
- Uncluttered layouts

## Style Rules

### Do

- Reduce complex ideas to simple symbols
- Use arrows to show flow or transition
- Maintain a clear visual hierarchy
- Use consistent shapes for similar types of information
- Keep labels brief and descriptive

### Don't

- Use realistic or detailed imagery
- Over-decorate with gradients or shadows (keep it flat)
- Use ambiguous symbols
- Clutter the space with unnecessary details

## Best For

Conceptual frameworks, abstract systems, information flow, social systems, and logical processes.
