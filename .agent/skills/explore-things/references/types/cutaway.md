# Cutaway (剖面图)

Slicing through the object to reveal internal layers, components, and their relationships.

## Core Objective
To show the "inside" of a complex assembly that is normally hidden by an outer shell.

## Visual Strategy
- Define a clear "cutting plane".
- Use cross-hatching or color differences to indicate where the material has been sliced.
- Highlighting internal components with contrast.

## Best For
Engines, buildings, anatomical structures, batteries, and multilayered electronic devices.

## Prompt Construction Tip
Specify what is being cut and what specific internal details should be revealed (e.g., "A cutaway view of a DSLR camera revealing the mirror box and CMOS sensor").
