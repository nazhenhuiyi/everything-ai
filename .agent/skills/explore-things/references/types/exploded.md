# Exploded (爆炸分解图)

Drawing components separated from each other but maintained in their relative functional positions.

## Core Objective
To show how individual parts fit together and the assembly sequence.

## Visual Strategy
- Components are "exploded" along a common axis.
- Use dashed "lead lines" to show where parts connect.
- Maintain a consistent perspective for all components.

## Best For
Mechanical assemblies, consumer products, LEGO sets, and modular systems.

## Prompt Construction Tip
Mention the primary axis of explosion and key components to be highlighted (e.g., "An exploded view of a mechanical watch movement, showing the balance wheel and escapement separated along the vertical axis").
