# Macaulay Style

Detailed line art, watercolor wash, warm, and explanatory style based on David Macaulay's work.

## Design Aesthetic

Detailed hand-drawn line art with hatching and cross-hatching to show texture and volume. Watercolor washes provide a warm, organic feel. The style is educational, inviting, and makes complex mechanical systems feel approachable and human.

## Background

- Color: Warm Off-White or Cream-colored paper background
- Texture: Paper texture with slight grain

## Visual Elements

- Detailed line drawings with variable line weights
- Extensive use of hatching and cross-hatching for shading
- Transparent or cutaway views to show internal mechanisms
- Handwritten-style labels and annotations (if any)
- Perspective that emphasizes the scale and complexity of the object

## Style Rules

### Do

- Use detailed line art to explain mechanics
- Incorporate watercolor-like color washes
- Maintain a warm, inviting, and educational tone
- Use "cutaway" or "exploded" views where appropriate
- Emphasize the "how it works" aspect

### Don't

- Use clean, clinical, or overly digital-looking lines
- Use high-saturation or neon colors
- Use 3D-rendered or photorealistic styles
- Over-complicate the background; keep focus on the subject

## Best For

Mechanical inventions, historical architecture, tools, and any object where "how it works" is best explained through internal views.
