# Microscopic (显微镜图)

Zooming into the material, cellular, or atomic level to show details invisible to the naked eye.

## Core Objective
To explain properties that emerge from micro-structure.

## Visual Strategy
- Use a "magnifying glass" or "zoom bubble" effect.
- Focus on textures, patterns, and repeating structures.
- Use scale indicators if necessary.

## Best For
Fabric fibers, plant cells, crystal structures, integrated circuits (silicon level), and chemical reactions.

## Prompt Construction Tip
Define the magnification level and the target micro-structure (e.g., "A microscopic view of a butterfly wing, showing the overlapping iridescent scales at 500x magnification").
